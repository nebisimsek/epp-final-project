## Usage

To get started, create and activate the environment with

```console
$ conda/mamba env create
$ conda activate epp_final_project
```

To build the project, type

```console
$ pytask
```

If some of the tasks fail when plotting the results please run it one more time.

The number of simulation, observation and time has decreased due to faster running time.
These values are adjustable under **task_analysis** folder.
